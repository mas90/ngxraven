To get started:

1. Download nginx source.
2. Download this module.
3. From nginx directory, run:

	./configure --add-module=/path/to/module/dir
	make
	make install (will land in "/usr/local/nginx")

4. Make a location configuration something like this:

	error_log	logs/error.log	info; # Optional, but useful to see some messages

	* * * * *

	location /test{
		RavenActive on;
		RavenLogin https://demo.raven.cam.ac.uk/auth/authenticate.html;
		RavenLogin https://demo.raven.cam.ac.uk/auth/logout.html;
		RavenSecretKey	qwertyui;
		RavenLazyClock	on;
		RavenAllow	test0001;
		RavenDeny	test0002;
		RavenAllow	test0003;
		RavenDeny	test0004;
		RavenAllow	test0005;
	}

	* * * * *

5. Get a copy of the public key for the test server from here:

	https://raven.cam.ac.uk/project/keys/demo_server/pubkey901.crt

6. Convert key to suitable format like this:

	openssl x509 -pubkey -noout -in pubkey901.crt > raven.pem

7. Make sure key is in the nginx "/usr/local/nginx/conf" directory (or modify code to suit).

8. Start nginx:

	/usr/local/nginx/sbin

A quick note about how the "RavenAllow" and "RavenDeny" directives work:

	- First match in rule chain wins (from top to bottom).
	- If there are no rules, there is an implicit "RavenAllow all".
	- If there are some rules, there is an implicit trailing "RavenDeny all" rule.
	- You can create a "blacklist" by preceding "RavenAllow all" with deny rules.
	- You can create a "whitelist" by preceding "RavenDeny all" with allow rules.
