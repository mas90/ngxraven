To get started:

1.  Download nginx source.
2.  Download this module.
3.  From nginx directory, run:

	./configure --add-module=/path/to/module/dir
	make
	make install (will land in "/usr/local/nginx")

4.  Make a location configuration something like this:

        error_log	logs/error.log	info; # Optional, but useful to see some messages

        * * * * *

        location /test {
                RavenActive on;
                RavenLogin https://demo.raven.cam.ac.uk/auth/authenticate.html;
                #RavenLogin https://demo.raven.cam.ac.uk/auth/logout.html;
                RavenSecretKey	qwertyui;
                RavenLazyClock	on;
                RavenAllow	test0001;
                RavenDeny	test0002;
                RavenAllow	test0003;
                RavenDeny	test0004;
                RavenAllow	test0005;
        }

        * * * * *

    Assuming you've used the default install location, the configuration file to add this to
    will be /usr/local/nginx/conf/nginx.conf

5.  For the configuration shown, you'll also need to create an html page to show at
    /usr/local/nginx/html/test/index.html

6.  Get a copy of the public key for the test server from here:

        https://raven.cam.ac.uk/project/keys/demo_server/pubkey901.crt

7.  Convert key to suitable format like this:

        openssl x509 -pubkey -noout -in pubkey901.crt > raven.pem

8.  Make sure key is in the nginx "/usr/local/nginx/conf" directory (or modify code to suit).

9.  Start nginx:

        cd /usr/local/nginx/sbin
        ./nginx

10. Visit the page http(s)://yourdomain/test/ to experience the Raven test server in all
    its glory.


A quick note about how the "RavenAllow" and "RavenDeny" directives work:

	- First match in rule chain wins (from top to bottom).
	- If there are no rules, there is an implicit "RavenAllow all".
	- If there are some rules, there is an implicit trailing "RavenDeny all" rule.
	- You can create a "blacklist" by preceding "RavenAllow all" with deny rules.
	- You can create a "whitelist" by preceding "RavenDeny all" with allow rules.
